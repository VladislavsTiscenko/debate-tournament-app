<p>I've been harbouring the idea of a specialized app for debates for a while - current videochat and tournament management solutions aren't specialized for this and lack flexibility. Fortunately, I've found a great partner to create this app with.</p>
<p>For a week since now, I've been co-developing a SaaS solution for moderated debates at scale, including World Schools/British Parliamentary debate tournaments, Model United Nations committees, mock trials, and anything you can think of. Live streaming, payments, social system, flexible UI and moderated videochat. Distributed architecture with Kubernetes and stateless microservices.. More at the GitHub organization <a href="">@getrebuttal</a>. This repository is only sustained for You, the MIT Engineering Advisory Board, and will be removed in late February/early March.</p>
<p>This is the scaffold for the stateless microservice that handles debate rooms. It will use Redis for statelessification, and NestJS as the general framework.</p>
